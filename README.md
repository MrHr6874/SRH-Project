# Project Title

Vulnerability Detector is a program that is designed to assess computers, networks, or applications for known weaknesses. These weaknesses make it viable for hackers to exploit vulnerabilities and access unauthorized sensitive files. Though many patching systems are in place to repair vulnerabilities, there are some critical fixes that are overlooked. Such oversight can be automatically identified by the Vulnerability Detector tool and produce a report with findings, which the administrators can utilize to rectify the weaknesses.

## Modules Information

Web crawler is an application that browses the World Wide Web to index web pages. It is operated by search engines. The web crawler enables the user to search data and extract key words in many languages using multiple filters covering a wide range of sources. The scraped data can be accessed by users from its archive. 

Network Scanner is a tool that can locate every device connected to a network, it maybe a large corporate network or small home networks. It is an IP scanner that can check if all the devices connected to the network are running smoothly. The Network Scanner shows all the shared resources, including system and hidden resources. It also checks access rights which the user can mount as a network drive open them in a browser.

A DNS lookup is the querying technique of the Domain Name System (DNS) to determine the domain name associated with an IP address – the reverse of the usual "forward" DNS lookup of an IP address from a domain name. The process of reverse resolving of an IP address uses PTR records. rDNS involves searching domain name registry and registrar tables. This may be used to try to identify the originator’s domain name to track, for example, a spammer sending spam emails or the domain name of a computer trying to break into a firewall or someone trying to hack the system. It may also be used to determine the name of the internet service provider assigned to a particular IP address.
