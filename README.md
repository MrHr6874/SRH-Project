# Network Analyzer 
Network Analyzer is a python-based Cybersecurity Multi-function tool in which we will develop several modules for analyzing computer networks, and applications. The tool will detect network-related data and provide a report automatically.

## Modules Information

Web scraping a web page involves fetching it and extracting from it. Fetching is the downloading of a page (which a browser does when a user views a page). Therefore, web crawling is a main component of web scraping, to fetch pages for later processing. Once fetched, then extraction can take place. The content of a page may be parsed, searched, reformatted, its data copied into a spreadsheet or loaded into a database. Web scrapers typically take something out of a page, to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else. An example would be to find and copy names and telephone numbers, or companies and their URLs, or e-mail addresses to a list. 

Network Scanner is a tool that can locate every device connected to a network, it maybe a large corporate network or small home networks. It is an IP scanner that can check if all the devices connected to the network are running smoothly. The Network Scanner shows all the shared resources, including system and hidden resources. It also checks access rights which the user can mount as a network drive open them in a browser.

A DNS lookup is the querying technique of the Domain Name System (DNS) to determine the domain name associated with an IP address – the reverse of the usual "forward" DNS lookup of an IP address from a domain name. The process of reverse resolving of an IP address uses PTR records. rDNS involves searching domain name registry and registrar tables. This may be used to try to identify the originator’s domain name to track, for example, a spammer sending spam emails or the domain name of a computer trying to break into a firewall or someone trying to hack the system. It may also be used to determine the name of the internet service provider assigned to a particular IP address.

DNS module has following record types:

AA : Address record (Returns a 32-bit IPv4 address, most commonly used to map hostnames to an IP address of the host)


AAAA: IPv6 address record (Returns a 128-bit IPv6 address, most commonly used to map hostnames to an IP address of the host)


MX : Mail exchange record  (Maps a domain name to a list of message transfer agents for that domain)


CNAME: Canonical name record (Alias of one name to another: the DNS lookup will continue by retrying the lookup with the new name.)


PTR : Pointer to a canonical name (Unlike a CNAME, DNS processing stops and just the name is returned. The most common use is for implementing reverse DNS lookups.)


Providing correct results is one of the key benefits which Google Public DNS provides. It puts priority on returning the right answer to a query. In cases when there is a query for a non-existent or mistyped domain name, users get an NXDOMAIN response, which indicates no known response, to their query.


Google DNS is 8.8.8.8


We can use any other DNS server IP

| :------------     |   ------------: | ------------:    |
| Google’s DNS      | `8.8.8.8`       | `8.8.4.4`        |
| OpenDNS           | `208.67.222.222`| `208.67.220.220` |
| DNS Watch         | `84.200.69.80`  | `84.200.70.40`   |
